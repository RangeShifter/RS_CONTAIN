# RS_CONTAIN
Customised variant of RangeShifter v2 for the management of invasive species

The new features comprise a module for simulating the removal (culling) of the invasive species, new dispersal options for transfer by animal vectors or by wind, 
and the inclusion of habitat-dependent demography. 

Each new feature is optional, and they may be applied in combination (except that the two new dispersal models are mutually exclusive) 
and with any appropriate existing options of RangeShifter.

Users are strongly advised to familiarise themselves with RangeShifter and to undertake its tutorials before attempting to use RS_CONTAIN.

THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF MARCH 2023
