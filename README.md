# RS_CONTAIN
Customised variant of RangeShifter v2 for the management of invasive species

The new features comprise a module for simulating the removal (culling) of the invasive species, new dispersal options for transfer by animal vectors or by wind, 
and the inclusion of habitat-dependent demography. 

Each new feature is optional, and they may be applied in combination (except that the two new dispersal models are mutually exclusive) 
and with any appropriate existing options of RangeShifter.

Users are strongly advised to familiarise themselves with RangeShifter and to undertake its tutorials before attempting to use RS_CONTAIN.

RS_CONTAIN comprises two executable files, a user manual and documentation for running batchmode simulations. The manual describes only the new features of the software. For all other information, please refer to the RangeShifter v2.0 user manual.
